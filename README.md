# OOP-Project---Online-Help-Desk

1. Fully functional help desk project, But TIcket and Knowledge base are available in this project.
2. have used User and Analyst as the main two types of users.
3. The index page will set sessions according to the user type.
4. Contents are web pages will be changed according to the session("type") and if/else would did the trick.
5. On the Ticket page, there is a live search that gets data from "data.json" file.
6. I used to get JSON format data from the query in json.txt, and I had to copy data from SQL query to JSON file manually or work another way around.
7. In *list JSP files, there is a feature where priority gets a custom red opacity according to priority values by setting the alpha value by multiplying priority values with 0.2.
8. I think other required things like "Config.properties", "TicketQuery.xml", "CommonConstants", and other essential requirements are included.
9. If you want to work with my project it's better to copy my files to a newly created java project or get my repo as a template.
10. It is needed few improvements down the line to make it more robust.
