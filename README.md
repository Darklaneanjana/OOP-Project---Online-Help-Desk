# OOP-Project---Online-Help-Desk

1. Fully functional help desk project, But TIcket and Knowledge base are available in this project.
2. I have used User and Analyst as main two types of users.
3. Index page will set sessions according to the user type.
4. Contents is web pages will changed according to the session("type") and if/else would did the trick.
5. In Ticket page there is a live search which gets data from "data.json" file.
6. I used to get json format data from the query in json.txt, and I had to copy data from sql query to json file manually or work another way around.
7. In *list jsp files there is a feature where priority get a custom red opacity according to priority values by setting the alpha value by multiplling priority values with 0.2.
8. I think other required things like "Config.properties", "TicketQuery.xml", "CommonConstants" and other essential requirements are are included.
9. If you want work with my project its better copy my files to newly created java project or get my repo as a template.
10. It is needed few improvements down the line to make it more robust.
